I thought I had more time before the videos were published on YouTube. ðŸ˜‰ It will be complete by 2022-04-28!\n\nWelcome to Entity Framework Core for beginners! This is **Part 1**. I'm going to walk you through this video."

Set your location to `parts/1-getting-started/ContosoPizza`. Assuming you are currently in the *workspace* or *ef-core-for-beginners* directory, use the following command:\n\n    <br />\n\n    ```dotnet-cli\n    cd parts/1-getting-started/ContosoPizza/\n    ```\n    <br />\n\n1. Install the `dotnet-ef` tool with the following command:\n  \n    <br />\n\n    ```bash\n    dotnet tool install -g dotnet-ef --version 6.0.4\n    ```\n    <br />\n\n1. Install the required packages with the following commands:\n  \n    <br />\n    \n    ```bash\n    dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer --version 6.0.4\n    dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools --version 6.0.4\n    dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design --version 6.0.4\n    ```\n    <br />\n\n> **Why are we specifying a version for these packages and the `dotnet-ef` tool?** Typically, you probably don't need to specify a version, and the latest release is recommended. In this case, the code for parts 2-5 *already uses* the `6.0.4` packages, so we're specifying those versions here to ensure the `dotnet-ef` tool version matches."

Note: Since there are no files in *1-getting-started*, VS Code will display the subdirectory *ContosoPizza* on the same line by default.\n1. Right-click on the *parts/1-getting-started/ContosoPizza* folder\n1. Select **New Folder**. Name it *Models*.\n1. Right click the *Models* folder and select **New File**. Name it *Customer.cs*, after which you will be looking at an empty file. Return to the **CodeTour** tab to continue. \n1. Repeat the previous step to create the following empty files:\n    - *Order.cs*\n    - *OrderDetail.cs*\n    - *Product.cs*\n\n## Create the `DbContext` file:\n\n1. Right-click on the *parts/1-getting-started/ContosoPizza* folder in the WORKSPACE pane.\n1. Select **New Folder**. Name it *Data*.\n1. Right click the *Models* folder and select **New File**. Name it *ContosoPizzaContext.cs*.\n\n## Double-check file names and paths\n\nYour workspace should resemble the following screenshot. Double-check before proceeding. The CodeTour cannot proceed without correctly named files.\n\n![Screengrab of the author's workspace](.tours/media/1-workspace-with-files.png)"
